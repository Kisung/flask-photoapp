Flask Photo App
======

This repository extends the source code examples for my O'Reilly book [Flask Web Development](http://www.flaskbook.com). It is forked from [Flasky](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky).

The blogging application is extended to include photos, and the dependencies have been updated to more recent versions.
